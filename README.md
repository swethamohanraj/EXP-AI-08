## AIM:
To solve Wumpus World Problem using Python demonstrating Inferences from Propositional Logic

## PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:

<b> Wumpus World </b>

The Wumpus world is a simple world example to illustrate the worth of a knowledge-based agent and to represent knowledge representation.
The figure below shows a Wumpus world containing one pit and one Wumpus. There is an agent in room [1,1]. The goal of the agent is to exit the Wumpus world alive. The agent can exit the Wumpus world by reaching room [4,4]. The wumpus world contains exactly one Wumpus and one pit. There will be a breeze in the rooms adjacent to the pit, and there will be a stench in the rooms adjacent to Wumpus.

Wumpus World Representation
This is a python program that uses propositional logic sentences to check which rooms are safe.

It is assumed that there will always be a safe path that the agent can take to exit the Wumpus world. The logical agent can take four actions: Up, Down, Left and Right. These actions help the agent move from one room to an adjacent room. The agent can perceive two things: Breeze and Stench.
